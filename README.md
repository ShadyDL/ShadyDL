# âœ¨ About me âœ¨ 
Hi, Iâ€™m Shady! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm mostly a backend developer with strong knowledge of DevOps.
I mostly use Github to display my public projects and save some useful gists.
Other than that I use a bunch of other platforms to store source code. Mainly [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Azure Repositories](https://dev.azure.com/).

Here are some of my favourite tools per category
ranked from favourite to least favourite:

### Backend
- .NET CORE - C#
- NodeJS - JavaScript
- Spring - Java
- SQL
- Python
- Kotlin

### Front-End
- ReactJS
- VueJS

### DevOps

- Github Actions
- Jenkins

### Containers

### Container Orchestration
- MicroKubes

### App Development
- Xamarin
- Swift
- Android Studio
